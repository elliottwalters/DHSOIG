I did two in infogram real quick to get an idea on how things might end up looking. Really basic chart but it highlights the biggest issue. The bars are way to fat though. It looked better on the site before I published it here.

I decided to try stacked bars and I am happier with the results. The jump is very clear. Red for emphasis on the big jump. Not sure if I like the bold color or not.
